#Secrets project

A simple web application that demonstrates basic Express.js functionality, including routing, serving static files, and handling POST requests. Users can enter a password to access a secret page.

(Inside the secret page you'll find some of my fundamental beliefs or life thoughts )

#Introduction

This project is a basic example of how to use Express.js for handling routes and POST requests. It includes a form for users to enter a password. If the password is correct, they gain access to a secret page; otherwise, they see an error message.

#Frontend Logic (index.html)

	•	A simple HTML form to collect the password.
	•	Form submission is handled via a POST request to /check.
